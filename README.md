# Car Plate Detection and OCR Extraction

A Streamlit-based application that detects car plates using YOLO and extracts text from the plates using PaddleOCR.

## Features
- **YOLO-based car plate detection**: Detects number plates from images.
- **OCR extraction**: Reads text from detected plates using PaddleOCR.
- **Annotated image display**: Shows processed images with bounding boxes.
- **Text overlay on images**: Displays extracted text on images.
- **Results export**: Saves OCR results as a CSV file.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed, then install dependencies:

```bash
pip install streamlit opencv-python pandas ultralytics paddleocr numpy
```

## Usage
Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Steps:
1. Upload the YOLO model (`.pt` file).
2. Provide the image folder path.
3. Process images to detect plates and extract text.
4. View annotated images and extracted text.
5. Export results as a CSV file.

## Project Structure
```
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                    # Streamlit app
â”œâ”€â”€ result
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ annotation_output      # Annotated images
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cropped_img_folder     # Cropped plate images
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ result_folder          # Processed results
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ final_output_folder    # Final output images
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ocr_results.csv        # Extracted text results
```

## Example Output
